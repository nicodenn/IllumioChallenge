# IllumioChallenge
a. how you tested your solution
    I tested my solution using a sample file that I altered the data for to account for any edge cases that I could think of and tried to encompass the widest variety of data possible.
b. any interesting coding, design, or algorithmic choices you’d like to point out
    I iterated through a lot of different ideas of how to go about this problem but I ended up moving forward with the first and most straightforward idea I had because it paired the simplest code structure with a relatively efficient solution that produces results in O(n) time. 
c. any refinements or optimizations that you would’ve implemented if you had
more time
    Yes, the code could have been modulated better with more helper functions utilized, specifically when analyzing the ports. But, I figured with limited time I should prioritize a functional and efficient solution and focus on the structure of the code after.
d. anything else you’d like the reviewer to know
    

I am most interested in being on the data team but would also enjoy the platform team!
