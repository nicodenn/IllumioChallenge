# IllumioChallenge
a. I tested my solution using a sample file that I altered the data for to account for any edge cases that I could think of and tried to encompass the widest variety of data possible.

b. I iterated through a lot of different ideas of how to go about this problem but I ended up moving forward with the first and most straightforward idea I had because it paired the simplest code structure with a relatively efficient solution that produces results in O(n) time. 

c. Yes, the code could have been modulated better with more helper functions utilized, specifically when analyzing the ports. But, I figured with limited time I should prioritize a functional and efficient solution and focus on the structure of the code after. I also realized at the end of my time, while testing, that there was an error in the way the IP addresses were checked. By checking the validity of an IP one integer at a time, the rule could be valid but still denied because one of the integers in the IP was out of range, when the IP as a whole would have been within the range. If I had more time, I would have fixed this issue. 

d. anything else youâ€™d like the reviewer to know
    I am very excited to be considered for this position!
    

I am most interested in being on the data team but would also enjoy the platform team!
